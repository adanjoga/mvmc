**MVMC** is multiview data clustering algorithm based on multiobjective evolutionary optimization, where the multiview property refers to the availability of multiple feature sets and/or multiple relational descriptions. The approach takes advantage of many-objective optimization concepts to explore a range of (Pareto optimal) trade-offs, while scaling to settings with three or more data views.


**MVMC** is described in detail in our paper:
